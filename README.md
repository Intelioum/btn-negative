# btn-negative
A little extension to bootstrap, adding buttons that match their parent's colors

<h2>Installation :</h2>

Place the .js and the .css files in your app filesystem, and link them in your HTML :

<code>&lt;link href="path/btn-negative.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</code>

<code><script src="path/btn-negative.js" type="text/javascript"></script></code>

Make sure to include them **after** the bootstrap files.

<h2>Usage :</h2>

It works the same way than regular bootstrap buttons.
Documentation here : https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/

It supports `block`, `disable`, and `active` classes.

Tested with Bootstrap 4.0 and JQuery 3.3.1.
